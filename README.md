Class imbalance is a major problem when dealing with real-
world datasets, especially disease datasets. The majority class often con-
sists of non-patient or negative samples while the minority class consists
of patient, i.e., positive samples. This imbalance weakens the learning
ability of a classifier as supervised learning is governed by classification
accuracy, and the classifier disregards the minority class and identities
almost all the samples as belonging to the majority class. Researchers
often use undersampling, oversampling or a combination of both tech-
niques to address this skewness in datasets. In this paper, we use a novel
method where we form a Venn diagram-based ensemble of different un-
dersampling algorithms instead of relying on a standalone undersampling
algorithm, thereby leading to a more robust model. The proposed method
has been evaluated on three class imbalanced disease datasets namely,
Indian Liver Patient dataset, Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and Cervical
Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset. Experimental outcomes show that the en-
semble approach outperforms some state-of-the-art methods considered
here for comparison. The source code along with the relevant datasets
